# Canvas Template

Simple template to make simulations and games with the HTML5 Canvas and Typescript. Template example is 
a cannon that shoots balls. The balls have gravity and frictional damping applied to them 
as well as simple collision detection for walls and other balls.

Object-oriented programming is used for this game, implementing classes such as `Vector2`, `Cannon`,
`Draw`, `CannonBall` and `Physics`. 

Typescript is compiled to JavaScript to run in the browser using `tsc`.
